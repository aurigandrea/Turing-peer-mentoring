# Turing-peer-mentoring
Vision Statement: This project aims to build upon the format of the Open Life Sciences programme and adapt the format using The Turing Way guides for data science, delivered to an interdisciplinary group of Turing affiliated researchers. Using the Turing Way handbook and drawing on expertise from the broader community, we aim to pilot a 12 week programme involving the initial surveying of our target audience, set up of a GitHub repository to host materials, formation of diverse groups to facilitate peer-mentoring, development of a training framework and schedule and implementation of continuous feedback and assessment for both learners and trainers. Our goal is for long standing community engagement in the Turing, positive feedback from participants and to have a new format of learning for our training offerings.
